## My process

I started by creating a section container to center the whole card, then continued with applying the styles to the background, image and texts. After that, I continued by applying a media query to make it responsive to smaller devices, such as phones and tablets.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow


### Continued development

Creating this product preview card and making it responsive, I think it will be useful in the future, as it may help developing product cards in any kind of e-commerce website. Also, the responsive media query could be used as a template in any other kind of card or container included in other kinds of websites
